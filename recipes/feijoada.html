        <h2>This feijoada recipe is my version of a traditional Brazilian black bean stew that maintains the rich smoky, flavors famous in Brazil. Additional meats, including sausage, may be added if desired. This is excellent served over brown rice.</h2>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        
        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>

            <li>1 ½ cups chopped onion, divided</li>

            <li>½ cup green onions, chopped</li>

            <li>1 clove garlic, chopped</li>

            <li>1 (12 ounce) package dry black beans, soaked overnight</li>

            <li>2 smoked ham hocks</li>

            <li>8 ounces diced ham</li>

            <li>½ pound thickly sliced bacon, diced</li>

            <li>2 bay leaves, crushed</li>

            <li>⅛ teaspoon ground coriander</li>

            <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>

        <h4>Now, let's go to the steps!</h4>

        <ol>
            <li>
                Step 1
                <p>Heat oil in a large pot or Dutch oven. Add 3/4 cup chopped onion, green onions, and garlic; cook and stir until softened, about 4 minutes. Pour in soaked beans and fill with enough water to cover beans by 3 inches. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer uncovered for 2 hours, or until tender;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Step 2
                <p>While beans are cooking, place ham hocks in a smaller pot with 1/4 cup chopped onion. Cover with water and simmer until meat pulls off of the bone easily, about 1 hour. Drain and add to beans;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Step 3
                <p>Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C);</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Step 4
                <p>Place ham, bacon, and remaining onion in a baking dish. Bake until mixture is crispy, 15 minutes;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Step 5
                <p>Drain bacon and ham mixture and add to beans. Season with bay leaves, coriander, salt, and pepper. Simmer, uncovered, 30 minutes more;</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                Step 6
                <p>Stir in chopped cilantro and parsley just before serving;</p>
